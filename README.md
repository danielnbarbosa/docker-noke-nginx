noke.bit website.

.bit domains are registered in a decentralized manner via the Namecoin blockchain.  To resolve in your browser either use a proxy or install the google chome plugin from https://dotbit.me/.

Note that this is just a silly little static site I'm using to play with CoreOS and namecoin.
